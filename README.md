Learn to build a WordPress APP
================================

This is a starting point and tutorial app for those wanting to learn how to build an app with WP-API. You can follow commits and pushes here, or follow the blog articles [on my blog](http://www.roysivan.com/blog)
  
The Build
===========  
* [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org)
* [WP-API](http://github.com/WP-API/WP-API)
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
  
The App
========  
Still to be determined, go to my [first blog post](http://www.roysivan.com/lets-build-wordpress-app-together-one/#.VA4tHvmwLYh) to give input on what you want to build, or let me know if you like one of my ideas.
  
__Plugin__ - [Collaborative Plugin Build](https://github.com/Build-WordPress-Application/wp-app-plugin)  
  
  
The Theme
===========  
The theme is built on [https://github.com/roots/roots](Roots.IO) theme, to get it running follow their instructions to install all necessary components
  
Global Variable Definitions
-----------------------------
*__APIdata__ - Object containing `api_url` and `api_nonce` for use with WP-API
*__wpApp__ - Globally defined Angular App `var wpApp = angular.module('wpApp', ['ngRoute', 'ngResource']);`  
  
  
Current Ideas
--------------
* __Curated user submitted article directory__ - for intermediate / advanced WP and OOP programming
* __Social color swatch site__
* __A new WP theme__ - A new version for [My AngularJS WordPress theme](https://github.com/royboy789/Angular-Wordpress-Theme)
* __ToDoMVC Clone for WP__ - A single backend and multiple themes with different types of front end libraries
